==============================
WHAT IS GIT?
==============================

Git is a version control system.
In simple words, Git helps us to track changes in our code.

Whenever we change a file, Git remembers:
- what was changed
- who changed it
- when it was changed

So if something goes wrong, we can go back to the old version.

Git works on our local machine (PC / laptop).
It does not need internet to work.

Git is a software (tool) that we install on our system.


==============================
WHAT IS GITHUB?
==============================

GitHub is a cloud platform / website.
It is used to store Git repositories online.

In simple words:
Git = works locally
GitHub = stores code online

GitHub helps us to:
- backup code
- share code with other developers
- work together in a team

Without Git, GitHub cannot work.
First we use Git, then we connect it to GitHub.


==============================
WHAT IS VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM?
==============================

Version control system means:
keeping track of different versions of files.

Instead of saving:
project_final
project_final_v2
project_final_latest

Git manages versions automatically.


==============================
TYPES OF VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS
==============================

1) Local Version Control System (LVCS)

In this:
- files are stored only on local machine
- no collaboration with other developers
- example: manual backups

Problem:
If system crashes, code is lost.


2) Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)

In this:
- one central server stores code
- developers connect to that server
- example: SVN

Problem:
If server goes down, no one can work.


3) Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)

In this:
- every developer has full copy of code
- can work offline
- example: Git

This is the best system.
That’s why we use Git.


==============================
GIT BASIC CONCEPTS
==============================

Working Directory:
Where we create or modify files.

Staging Area:
Where files are kept before commit.

Repository:
Where files are permanently saved by Git.


==============================
WHAT IS A REPOSITORY?
==============================

Repository means:
a folder which Git tracks.

It contains a hidden folder called .git
That .git folder stores all history.


==============================
WHAT IS A COMMIT?
==============================

Commit means:
saving changes permanently in Git.

Each commit has:
- unique id
- message
- snapshot of files


==============================
WHAT IS A BRANCH?
==============================

Branch means:
separate line of development.

Main branch is usually called master or main.

We use branches to:
- work on new features
- fix bugs
without affecting main code


==============================
WHY WE USE GIT & GITHUB
==============================

We use Git to:
- track changes
- manage versions
- work safely

We use GitHub to:
- store code online
- collaborate with team
- share projects


==============================
GIT COMMANDS (AFTER THEORY)
==============================

ls
→ shows files and folders

ls -a
→ shows hidden files like .git

mkdir folder_name
→ creates a folder

touch file_name
→ creates file (Git Bash)

New-Item file_name
→ creates file (PowerShell)


git init
→ initializes Git repository in existing folder

git status
→ checks status of files

git add file_name
→ adds specific file to staging area

git add .
→ adds all files to staging area

git commit -m "message"
→ saves changes permanently

git log
→ shows commit history


git branch
→ shows all branches

git branch branch_name
→ creates new branch

git checkout branch_name
→ switches branch


git remote add origin URL
→ connects local repo to GitHub

git push origin master
→ uploads code to GitHub

git pull origin master
→ downloads code from GitHub


==============================
INTERVIEW SUMMARY (IN MY WORDS)
==============================

Git is a distributed version control system
used to track changes in code locally.

GitHub is a cloud platform
used to host Git repositories online.

First we use Git on local machine,
then we push code to GitHub for sharing and collaboration.
